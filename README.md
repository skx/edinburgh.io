This repository contains a collection of data relating to Public Houses,
located in Edinburgh, Scotland.

As well as the data there is a simple tool which will read this data
and build a series of HTML pages to describe it.


Pub Data
--------

There are several sites out there which contain lists of pubs, and
reviews of them.  However I'm interested in tracking what they look
like.

Specifically pubs change hands pretty regularly, they change owner,
change name, and change theme.  I'd love to see a historical archive
of all the names a pub had, all the guises it traded under.

The idea of a map-presentation is just a useful sidetrack, with an
aim to present things more easily, the ultimate goal is to collect
data on pubs:

* The names of pubs.
* The location - lat/long.
* Images of pubs.
* Contact details are nice, as are website links.


How can you help?
-----------------

You can help by submitting new pub-details.   You can see existing
data in the `data/` sub-directory.

If you have matching photographs please ensure they are 450px high.
