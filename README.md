edinburgh.io
============

This repository will build the website located at http://edinburgh.io/

The website will contain a list of pubs, along with contact details, photographs, & etc.


Implementation
--------------

The website will have two purposes:

* First to display things.
* Secondly to make the data available.

The data for each venue will include:

* The name.
* The location (lattitude+longditude).
* The contact details.
* A series of photographs.

While reviews are nice over time they tend towards "1 star" or "5 star"
and I'm just going to stop the hassle.
